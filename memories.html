    <h2>My Memories</h2>
    <p>I remember logging onto AIM after school. Hearing that dial-up tone always brings me back. Everyone had their own weird screen names and pixel hearts next to their crush's name.</p>
    <p>Back then, websites felt personal — like each one had its own story. There wasn’t a “like” button, just creativity and self-expression.</p>
    <p>It’s funny how the old web looked messy but felt more real than anything now.</p>
