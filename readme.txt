Digital Time Capsule (Draft Version)
By: Kamel Simmons

Description:
This is my draft version of my Capstone project called 'Digital Time Capsule.'
I used HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript to create a retro Windows-style site
that tells a story through old-school design and nostalgic memories.

How to View:
1. Open 'index.html' in your browser to start exploring.
2. Click the icons to open memory windows or learn more about the project.
3. This is a silent version without sound for easier submission.

Files Included:
- index.html
- memories.html
- about.html
- style.css
- script.js
- readme.txt
