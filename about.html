    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This site is part of my Capstone project. I wanted to bring back the feeling of the early internet — simple, creative, and full of personality. It’s a mix of design, storytelling, and emotion that reflects how our memories change over time.</p>
    <p>My goal was to make something that feels human and nostalgic, like browsing an old computer full of memories from another time.</p>
